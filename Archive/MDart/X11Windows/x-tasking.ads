package X.Tasking is

    --  ************************************************************
    --  The underlying X system, written in C, is not tasking-safe.
    --  The Ada binding does nothing to change this.
    --  An application that makes calls to X from multiple Ada tasks
    --  probably should protect those calls.  This resource could
    --  be used.  The usage would be:
    --
    --     X.Resource.Seize;
    --     X.Some_Package.Some_Function;
    --     X.Resource.Release;
    --
    --  Alternatively one could build a protected type that does
    --  the same thing, and then declare an object of the protected
    --  type in each scope that makes a call to X.
    --  ************************************************************

    protected Resource is 
        entry Seize;
        procedure Release;
    private
        X_Is_In_Use: Boolean := False;
    end Resource;
