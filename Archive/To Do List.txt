- Sphere3D Intersection does not support rays starting inside the sphere
- Cube3D Intersection not tested yet when rays starting inside the cube
- Cylinder3D Intersection not tested yet when rays starting inside the cube
- Cylinder3D Intersection speed up: If Yo > 1 and Yd > 0 then no hit; same for < -1
	This might apply to other Intersection routines as well
